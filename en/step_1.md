## You will make

You are going to create a party game that you can play with your friends to have fun! 

You can base your party game on one you have played before.

Your party game will need to meet the **project brief**.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
A <span style="color: #0faeb0">project brief</span> describes what a project must do. It's a bit like being given a mission to complete.
</p>

You will need to decide what type of game you would like to make and who it is for.

Your game should:

- Show an image you design on the LEDs
- Let a player start the game
- Play sounds and/or show icons on the LEDs
- Let the players control the game using buttons, the touch logo, movement or sounds
- Show a winning result or prize at the end of the game

Your game **could**:
- Let the user enter the number of players
- Use a timer
- Have levels
- Keep a count of a value or a high score.
- Have a reset feature
- Log data
- Organise code using functions
- Be powered from the battery pack

### Get ideas

Think about how your game will start, how a player wins the game and how the game ends as you investigate these example projects to get more ideas:

### Musical chairs

In this project, the micro:bit is used to control a game of musical chairs.

The number of players is set to `4`, so line up `3` chairs to play the game!

- Watch the startup animation of someone sitting on a chair.
- A flashing arrow points to the touch logo.
- When you touch the logo:
  - You are shown a 3,2,1 countdown, then a picture of an empty chair.
  - A melody plays for a random amount of time (between 3 and 15 seconds).
  - All players should move around the chairs while the music plays!
  - When the music stops, a 'sit down' animation is shown.
  - All players should try to sit on a chair. The player left standing is removed from the game.
  - If there is more than one player in the game, `-1` is shown to tell you to remove a chair and a flashing arrow points to the touch logo again.
  - When there is only one chair left, the person to sit on it wins (and a smiley face icon is shown).
  
You can set the number of players using the A and B buttons.

You can shake the micro:bit to reset the game back to `4` players.

In this project, the micro:bit is used to show the score in a game of bottle flip.

Any number of players can play the game, but make sure you play with more than one person!

- Follow the startup instructions on the screen.
- When you press Button A:
  - You are shown more instructions and the number of the current player.
  - You can begin to flip the bottle, each landing of the bottle will give you a point score.
  - You can press Button B to end the player's turn and see your score.
  - Press Button A for the next player to flip the bottle.
  
You can press the Logo button to reset the game and start again.
