## You will make

You are going to create a party game to help you have fun. You game can be based on a party game you have played before.

Your party game will need to meet the **project brief**.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">
A <span style="color: #0faeb0">project brief</span> describes what a project must do. It's a bit like being given a mission to complete.
</p>

You will need to decide what type of game you would like to make and who it is for.

Your game should:

- Show an image you design on the LEDs
- Let a player start the game
- Play sounds and/or show icons on the LEDs
- Let the players control the game using buttons, the touch logo, movement or sounds
- Show a winning result or prize at the end of the game

Your game **could**:
- Let the user enter the number of players
- Use a timer
- Have levels
- Keep a count of a value or a high score.
- Have a reset feature
- Log data
- Organise code using functions
- Be powered from the battery pack
