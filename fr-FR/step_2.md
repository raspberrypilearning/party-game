## Your idea

Use this step to plan your party game. You can plan by just thinking, tinkering, drawing or writing, or however you like!

### What will you make?

\--- task ---

Think about the game you will use your micro:bit for.

- What are the rules of the game?
- How does someone win?
- Are there choices players have to make?
- Do players score points?
- Will the game be played inside or outside?

\--- /task ---

### Who is it for?

\--- task ---
Think about who you will make your party game for (your **audience**).

- Will they need longer to see the icons or text on the screen?
- Will they need sound as well as visual information?
- Will they be able to understand what an icon means?
- Are there any part of the micro:bit they might find hard to use?

### Get started

Use a notes app or pen and paper, or both, to plan ideas for your game.

Try to note down as many ideas as you can, and discuss them with a friend.

Then pick the idea that you like the most.

Give your project a name that matches the party game you want to make!

**Tip:** Giving your project a name that relates to the game youâ€™re creating will make it easier to find if you create other projects on MakeCode.
