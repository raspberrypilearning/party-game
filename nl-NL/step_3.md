## Build and test

Now it's time to make your party game!

**Tip:** ðŸ’¡ Remember to test your project each time you add something. It is easier to find and fix bugs before you make more changes.

You have built up some really useful skills.

Here is a reminder of some skills you could use to help you make your party game:

### How will your party game start?

\--- task ---

You could start your game by showing something on the LEDs.

\[\[\[microbit-icons]]]

\[\[\[microbit-animation]]]

\[\[\[microbit-text]]]

If your start-up screen is complicated, you might want to organise the code into a **function**.

\[\[\[microbit-function]]]

\--- /task ---

### How will a player win the game?

\--- task ---

Will a player score points?

\[\[\[microbit-counting]]]

Will they have to do something for a set time?

\[\[\[microbit-timer]]]

\--- /task ---

### What does a player have to do in the game?

\--- task ---

A player might need to use a trigger.

\[\[\[microbit-buttons]]]

\[\[\[microbit-mic]]]

\[\[\[microbit-gesture-trigger]]]

\[\[\[microbit-fine-movement]]]

A player might need to hear sounds.

\[\[\[microbit-playing-sounds]]]

\[\[\[microbit-volume]]]

Will they need to make choices?

\[\[\[microbit-making-choices]]]

Will you need to show or use random numbers?

\[\[\[microbit-random-numbers]]]

You might have some code that only runs if a player has completed a task.

\[\[\[microbit-flags]]]

### How does the game end?

\--- task ---

You could end your game by showing something on the LEDs.

\[\[\[microbit-text]]]

\[\[\[microbit-icons]]]

\[\[\[microbit-animation]]]

\[\[\[microbit-function]]]

\[\[\[microbit-plot-graph]]]

You could store the points scored to the micro:bit to use later.

\[\[\[microbit-datalogging]]]

\--- /task ---

### Where will your game be played?

\--- task ---

You might need to play your game away from your computer.

\[\[\[microbit-batteries]]]

\--- /task ---

\[\[\[download-to-microbit]]]

\--- task ---

**Test:** Show someone else your game and get their feedback.

Do you want to make any changes?
